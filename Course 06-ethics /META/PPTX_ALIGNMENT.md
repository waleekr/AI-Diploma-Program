## ✅ Alignment Verification

### **What We Have:**
- ✅ Complete course structure matching the 5 units
- ✅ Unit 1: 3 examples + 1 exercise + 1 solution (fully aligned)
- ✅ Unit 2: 1 example (bias detection - aligned)
- ✅ All notebooks created and validated
- ✅ Visualizations planned and implemented for Unit 1

### **What Matches PPTX Files:**
- ✅ Unit 1 content aligns with expected PPTX topics (01-03)
- ✅ Unit 2 starts with bias detection (04)
- ⏳ Units 3-5 need content development to match PPTX files 07-14

### **Gaps to Address:**
- [ ] Create Unit 2 additional examples (fairness metrics, bias mitigation)
- [ ] Create Unit 3 examples (privacy, security)
- [ ] Create Unit 4 examples (SHAP, LIME, transparency)
- [ ] Create Unit 5 examples (governance, regulations)

## 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Review PPTX Files:** Extract topics from each PPTX to ensure exact alignment
2. **Create Missing Content:** Develop examples for Units 3-5 to match PPTX files 07-14
3. **Add More Unit 2 Content:** Create fairness metrics and bias mitigation examples
4. **Cross-Reference:** Ensure each PPTX file has corresponding code examples/exercises

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Extract content from PPTX files to understand exact topics
2. Create examples for each PPTX topic
3. Ensure visualizations match PPTX slide content
4. Add exercises aligned with PPTX learning objectives

---

**Status:** Course structure aligns with PPTX organization. Unit 1 fully covered, Units 2-5 need additional content development to match all 14 PPTX files.
