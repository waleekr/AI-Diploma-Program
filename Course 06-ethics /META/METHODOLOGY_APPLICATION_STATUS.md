## ✅ Completed: First Notebook (`01_ethical_frameworks.ipynb`)

### What Has Been Applied

1. **✅ Prerequisites Section** - Complete with clear requirements
2. **✅ "Where This Fits" Section** - Shows connections to other content
3. **✅ "The Story" Section** - Relatable metaphor about ethical lenses
4. **✅ BEFORE/AFTER Sections** - Throughout all parts
5. **✅ Detailed Inline Comments** - Every code line explains WHAT and WHY
6. **✅ Step-by-Step Progress** - Print statements showing what's happening
7. **✅ Function Documentation** - HOW IT WORKS, WHEN to use, WHY use
8. **✅ Part Structure** - Following Course02 pattern:
   - Part 1: Setting the Scene
   - Part 2: Understanding Frameworks (with prerequisites, relationship, story)
   - Part 3: Comparing Frameworks
   - Part 4: Applying to Scenarios
   - Summary and Takeaways

### Minor Cleanup Needed

- Cell 5 has some markdown mixed with code (needs separation)
- Final summary cell needs to be added as markdown
