## Key Concepts

### Ethical Frameworks

**Utilitarianism:** Focuses on maximizing overall happiness or utility. In AI, this means creating systems that benefit the greatest number of people.

**Deontology:** Emphasizes duties and rules. In AI, this means following ethical principles regardless of outcomes.

- **Justice:** Fair distribution of benefits and burdens
- **Transparency:** Openness about how systems work
- **Accountability:** Taking responsibility for outcomes
