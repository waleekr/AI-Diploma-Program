## Part 2: Short Answer (20 points)

### Question 6 (10 points)
Explain why fairness is important in AI systems. Provide an example of unfair AI and how it could be addressed.

**Answer:**
Fairness is crucial because AI systems can perpetuate or amplify existing biases, leading to discrimination against certain groups. For example, a hiring algorithm trained on historical data might favor certain demographics if the training data reflects past biases. This can be addressed by:
1. Ensuring diverse and representative training data
2. Regularly auditing models for bias
3. Using fairness metrics during evaluation
4. Involving diverse stakeholders in development

### Question 7 (10 points)
Describe the importance of transparency in AI. What are some methods to make AI systems more transparent?

**Answer:**
Transparency is important because it builds trust, enables accountability, and helps identify issues. Methods include:
1. Explainable AI techniques (LIME, SHAP)
2. Clear documentation of data sources and model decisions
3. User-friendly explanations of predictions
4. Open communication about system limitations
5. Regular audits and reporting

## Part 3: Case Study (15 points)

### Question 8 (15 points)
A healthcare AI system is being developed to assist in diagnosis. Discuss the ethical considerations that should be addressed before deployment.

**Answer:**
Key ethical considerations:
1. **Accuracy and Safety**: System must be highly accurate to avoid misdiagnosis
2. **Bias**: Ensure system works equally well for all patient demographics
3. **Transparency**: Doctors need to understand how decisions are made
4. **Privacy**: Patient data must be protected and used appropriately
5. **Accountability**: Clear responsibility for decisions (AI-assisted, not AI-only)
6. **Informed Consent**: Patients should understand AI involvement
7. **Accessibility**: System should not create disparities in healthcare access
8. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular evaluation for performance and bias
