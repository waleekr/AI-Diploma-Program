## Key Concepts

### Governance Models

**Government-Led Regulation:**
- Top-down approach
- Legal enforcement
- Examples: EU AI Act, GDPR

**Industry Self-Regulation:**
- Bottom-up approach
- Voluntary compliance
- Examples: Partnership on AI, company ethics boards

**Multi-Stakeholder Governance:**
- Collaborative approach
- Includes government, industry, academia, civil society
- Examples: Global Partnership on AI

### Regulatory Approaches

**Risk-Based Approach (EU AI Act):**
- **Unacceptable Risk:** Banned applications
- **High Risk:** Strict requirements
- **Limited Risk:** Transparency obligations
- **Minimal Risk:** No specific obligations

**Principles-Based Approach:**
- General principles rather than specific rules
- Flexibility for different contexts
- Examples: OECD AI Principles

### Future Challenges

**AGI Safety:**
- Alignment problem
- Control problem
- Value alignment

**Autonomous Systems:**
- Self-driving cars
- Autonomous weapons
- Decision-making authority

**Societal Impact:**
- Job displacement
- Economic inequality
- Surveillance capitalism
- Environmental costs
