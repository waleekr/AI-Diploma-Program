## Part 2: Short Answer (20 points)

### Question 6 (10 points)
Explain the difference between pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation techniques. Provide an example of each.

**Answer:**
- **Pre-processing**: Address bias in training data before model training (e.g., rebalancing dataset, removing biased features)
- **In-processing**: Modify training algorithm to enforce fairness (e.g., adding fairness constraints to loss function)
- **Post-processing**: Adjust model outputs after training (e.g., threshold adjustment for different groups)

### Question 7 (10 points)
Describe a real-world case of algorithmic bias. What was the issue, who was affected, and how could it have been prevented?

**Answer:**
Example: COMPAS recidivism prediction system showed racial bias, predicting higher risk for Black defendants. Could be prevented by:
1. Diverse training data
2. Regular bias audits
3. Fairness metrics during development
4. Transparency in methodology
5. Human oversight in decisions

## Part 3: Case Study (15 points)

### Question 8 (15 points)
A hiring AI system shows bias against certain groups. Describe how you would:
1. Detect the bias
2. Measure its extent
3. Mitigate it
4. Monitor ongoing fairness

**Answer:**
1. **Detection**: Analyze hiring rates by protected attributes, test model outputs, use fairness toolkits
2. **Measurement**: Calculate demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration metrics
3. **Mitigation**: Rebalance training data, add fairness constraints, adjust decision thresholds
4. **Monitoring**: Regular audits, track metrics over time, stakeholder feedback, continuous improvement
