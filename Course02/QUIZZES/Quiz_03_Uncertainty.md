## Part 2: Bayesian Inference (30 points)

### Question 5 (5 points)
Bayes' theorem is used for:
- A) Calculating probabilities
- B) Updating beliefs based on evidence
- C) Finding averages
- D) Sorting data

**Answer: B**

### Question 6 (10 points)
Given:
- P(Rain) = 0.3
- P(Cloudy | Rain) = 0.8
- P(Cloudy | No Rain) = 0.2

Calculate P(Rain | Cloudy) using Bayes' theorem.

**Answer: P(Rain | Cloudy) = (0.8 × 0.3) / ((0.8 × 0.3) + (0.2 × 0.7)) = 0.24 / 0.38 ≈ 0.632**
