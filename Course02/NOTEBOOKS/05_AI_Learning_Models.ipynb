    "2. **Let model learn**: Algorithm finds patterns automatically\n",
    "3. **Test on new data**: Verify it generalizes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 HOW THE SOLUTION SOLVES THE PROBLEM:\n",
    "- ✅ Instead of manual rules → Learned patterns from data\n",
    "- ✅ Instead of rigid → Flexible, adapts to real patterns\n",
    "- ✅ Instead of arbitrary → Based on actual relationships\n",

    "### 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER:\n",
    "- **BEFORE**: Problem → Manual rules → Poor performance\n",
    "- **AFTER**: Problem → Machine learning → Learns patterns, good performance!"
