## ⚠️ GAPS - What Could Be Improved

### 1. **Assessment Materials** (5/10) ⚠️
**Missing elements:**

- ❌ **No answer keys** for exercises
- ❌ **No quizzes** or self-assessment questions
- ❌ **No graded assignments** or projects
- ❌ **No rubrics** for evaluation
- ⚠️ **Practice exercises mentioned** but not clearly structured

**Recommendation:**
- Add answer keys/solutions (separate file or hidden cells)
- Create quiz questions for each notebook
- Add project assignments with rubrics

---

### 2. **Exercise Structure** (6/10) ⚠️
**Exercises need better organization:**

- ⚠️ **Practice exercises mentioned** in README but not clearly visible in notebooks
- ⚠️ **No difficulty levels** (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- ⚠️ **No hints** for struggling students
- ⚠️ **No sample solutions** provided

**Recommendation:**
- Add clearly marked "Exercise" sections in each notebook
- Include difficulty levels
- Provide hints and sample solutions

---

### 3. **Project Ideas** (6/10) ⚠️
**Limited project guidance:**

- ⚠️ **Project ideas mentioned** in README but not detailed
- ⚠️ **No project templates** or starter code
- ⚠️ **No project rubrics** or evaluation criteria
- ⚠️ **No step-by-step project guides**

**Recommendation:**
- Create detailed project descriptions
- Provide project templates
- Add project rubrics
- Create project guides

---

### 4. **Additional Resources** (7/10) ⚠️
**Could be more comprehensive:**

- ⚠️ **Limited external resources** listed
- ⚠️ **No video links** or multimedia resources
- ⚠️ **No dataset links** for practice
- ⚠️ **No community resources** (forums, Discord, etc.)

**Recommendation:**
- Add curated video resources
- Link to practice datasets
- Include community resources
- Add recommended books/papers

---

### 5. **Testing & Verification** (6/10) ⚠️
**Missing verification tools:**

- ❌ **No test files** to verify student code
- ❌ **No automated checking** of exercises
- ❌ **No code validation** scripts
- ⚠️ **Installation verification** exists but could be more comprehensive

**Recommendation:**
- Create test files for each notebook
- Add code validation scripts
- Create automated exercise checking
